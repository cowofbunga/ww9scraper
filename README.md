# ww9scraper
A script originally intended to iterate through the html structure of https://ww9.readonepiece.com/, so I could download the pages of each chapter
to my computer locally and read offline/without ads.

Script will allow the user to choose a specific chapter, or go through all available chapters and pick one, which will then download to a location
on user's computer.

In the current build, websites with the same structure as the original work as well. Also currently using argparse to allow user to specify chapter on the command line.

GUI made using Tkinter

TODO: Put program into an executable, create text file with necessary urls. Would like to allow user to chose url in GUI
