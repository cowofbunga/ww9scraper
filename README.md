# ww9scraper
A script originally intended to iterate through the html structure of https://ww9.readonepiece.com/, so I could download the pages of each chapter
to my computer locally and read offline/without ads.

Script will allow the user to choose a specific chapter, or go through all availible chapters and pick one, which will then download to a location
on user's computer.

In the current build, websites with the same structure as the original work as well.

TODO: Put program into an executable, create gui to allow user to select series and chapter. May want to create text file with necessary urls.
