# ww9scraper
A script originally intended to iterate through the html structure of https://ww9.readonepiece.com/, so I could download the pages of each chapter
to my computer locally and read offline/without ads.

Script will allow the user to choose a specific chapter, or go through all available chapters and pick one, which will then download to a location
on user's computer.

In the current build, websites with the same structure as the original work as well. Also currently using argparse to allow user to specify chapter on the command line.

GUI in production using Tkinter.

TODO: Put program into an executable, create gui to allow user to select series and chapter. May want to create text file with necessary urls.
