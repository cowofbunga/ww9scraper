Script to download all images from www9 website to read comics without being bothered by ads
So far only tested on One Piece specific site
Allows you to go through every chapter in order and pick which ones to view, or search specific one
When searching, low numbers are formatted as X00 or 0X0 (example: 002, 020)
not a problem when you get to the hundreds/thousands
